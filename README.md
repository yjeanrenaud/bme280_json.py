# bme280_json.py
I put together
https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2016/07/using-bme280-i2c-temperature-pressure-sensor-in-python/ 
and https://gist.github.com/nitaku/10d0662536f37a087e1b to have a simple json server on a Raspberry Pi in a remote place that has a BME280 connected to it.
The json data is then read by https://github.com/ingowalther/homebridge-advanced-http-temperature-humidity for homebridge
